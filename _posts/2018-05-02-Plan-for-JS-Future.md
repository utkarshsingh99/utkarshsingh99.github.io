I need to fix a plan for my learning in the future.  
After the exams are done, I need to finish freecodecamp as soon as possible, but with good projects which feature p5.js. It'll enhance my skills in that rarely used library.
Plus, it'll give my projects a great look which I can showcase as my work anywhere.

### Task 1: Get the FreeCodeCamp Certificate

Let's give this 15 days, I know it's not much time, but I'm going to be free anyway. So till June 1, I have to receive the Certificate.  

Immediately after that, I want to start Node.js. So the net says approximately a week/a month as the appropriate time duration for learning Node.js. I'll take the mean of it.  
Let's go with 2 weeks.

### Task 2: Learn Node.js

A week break for building a project based on my then found knowledge. I'm leaving the ideas for the project for later.

### Task 3: Celebrate with a project

After that, that is in the last week of June, I should begin learning React.js. This is a library quite in demand these days and by the looks of it, it does look interesting.
So I'm keeping the rest of the vacation for learning React.js only. I might try building a project using these libraries and frameworks combined.

### Task 4: Learn React.js

After I've done this, I will venture into 2 things:
1. React native
2. **Machine Learning and Tensorflow.js**

I really hope my vacation plan is executed by me in accordance with the deadlines. Only then can I think about organising these 2 things into my daily routine of the Academic Second Year.

All The Best Utkarsh Singh!
