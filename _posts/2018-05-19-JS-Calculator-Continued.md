### 11:25 pm - Shortlisting tasks

1. Construct core code of calculator.
[Optional]
2. History display
3. Notes

### Core code

Now I could either make a division, and put values in it through JS for every key press, or I could straightaway construct an input tag within the division and format it.  
I hope input tag can be styled the way I want it to, though. 

### 12:30 pm - Core Code of Calculator has been completed.

Now I'm moving forward to design the buttons and orientations of all these things.

### 1:15 pm - Design of basic core is complete.

Now I can either begin with the next project or I can build on the history thing in the calculator.  

#### AFK at 1:20 pm

### 1:41 pm - History work kept pending

Minor bugs fixed. Let's submit this and go on to the next project, I could come back to this when I'm done with freeCodeCamp.

## PROJECT COMPLETE
