### Continuing leftover Pomodoro Clock designing

Error: Bootstrap row class failing to construct seperate divisions of rows.  

Removed classes of container and row and added "position: absolute" to custom class. 

### 12:00 - Major code complete

Now I've done the project. But there's one big glitch. It's not responsive.

I have literally shunned Bootstrap. I think I can rebuild this using bootstrap's rows and columns although it was giving me problems before.

### 13:00 

Okay, project rebuilt in Bootstrap, and submitted.
Now moving on to Tic Tac Toe Game.
